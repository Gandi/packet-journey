.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
(Packet-journey) is a program that permit to switch quickly packets through
a fastpath and also to forward those packets to the kernel.
It permit also to rate-limit those packets or filtering them.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -offset indent
.It Fl -config Cm (port,queue_rx,lcore) Op ,(port,queue_rx,lcore)
Create and use a RX queue on a specific Port and select which core you use
for the forwarding.
You may set multiple tuples at the same time by separating them by a comma.
.It Fl -kniconfig Cm (port,lcore_tx,lcore_kthread)
Create a KNI which will be used by
.Nm
for sending certains packets to the kernel and for receiving packets from
the kernel to the fastpath.
.It Fl -enable-jumbo
Explicitly enable jumbo frames support, it's necessary with certain cards.
.It Fl -max-pkt-len Cm <64-9000>
Set the max RX packet lenghts, it may also needs to have jumbo frames
activated
.It Fl -promiscuous
Set the promiscuous mode on the Port. It's necessary if you want to receive
packets that have not your MAC address.
.It Fl -no-numa
Disable Numa awarness, it's necessary on non-numa platform.
.It Fl -aclavx2
Use AVX2 instructions for packet filtering.
.It Fl -unixsock Cm path
Set the path of the unixsock which may be used for connecting to the CLI,
by default /tmp/pktj.SOCKET_ID
.It Fl -configfile Cm path
Set the path of a configfile from which options would be taken. Its still
possible to override configfile options by passing args.
.It Fl -kni_rate_limit Cm pps
Select the max number of packets per second which will be sent from the
fastpath to the kernel. TCP 179 (BGP), ARP and ICMPv6 ND are not rate-limited.
.It -portmask Cm mask
Select which Ports will be used by
.Nm
from the Ports discovered by DPDK.
.It -callback-setup Cm path
Set a script to run after pktj has finished to init his KNI. The script
receive in arguments the name of the KNI and its MAC address.
.It -rule_ipv4 Cm path
File containing IPv4 ACLs. See below for the format.
.It -rule_ipv6 Cm path
File containing IPv6 ACLs. See below for the format.
.El
.Sh ACL FILE FORMAT
The file contains a line perf ACL rules, the lines have the format :
.Pp
@<src-ip> <dst-ip> <src-port-min>:<src-port-max> <dst-port-min>:<dst-port-max>
 <ip_proto_selected_bit>/<ip_proto_selection_mask>
.Pp
src-ip and dst-ip are written in CIDR notation. For filtering only on one of
the 2 IP you may put 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0.
.Pp
src-port-min:src-port-max define the range of filtered source ports.
Put 0/0xFFFF for bypassing the check.
.Pp
dst-port-min:dst-port-max define the range of filtered destination ports.
Put 0/0xFFFF for bypassing the check.
.Pp
ip_proto_selected_bit/ip_proto_selection_mask are applied on the IP protocol
field. ip_proto_selection_mask select the bits on which ip_proto_selected_bit
mask will be applied.
